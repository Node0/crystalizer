# crystalizer
A Map -> Reduce powerhouse,
disguised as an insight summarization tool.

Crystallizer is a programmable, LLM-powered
general purpose data traversal and transformation tool.

Its default use-case will be as insight extraction
and cohesion across N parts of long documents (think books).

However it can be programmed to do a large number
of open-ended tasks, owing to it's templated
system and task prompt design.
